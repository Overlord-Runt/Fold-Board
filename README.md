## The Fold Board
Its the second keyboard in my line of Taranium boards. It is a keyboard that folds! It has 66 Keys and an OLED for funny stuff.

If you like this project, please give it a star!

## CAD

Here is a full [CAD Build](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/464e86edd9a4b3695068071c/w/4e80d06eb9a86776c724470c/e/258c53a4e91dc0ec03e526f0) of the keyboard.\
It uses a rubber band to hold the 2 halves together and I am probably gonna have to work on the joint a bit when i get the parts.

The case is 44cm tall when layed flat out which is pretty good for a folding board. I made sure to keep the joint loose but strong enough to stay on so it doesnt wear down as much and stays nice. I suggest printing it from petg so you can get more slip.

Here are some shots of what it looks like open and folded.
