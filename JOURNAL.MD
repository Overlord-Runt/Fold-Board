# The Fold Board!

This is a super cool keyboard that I am making

It folds!

and fits nicely in a bag

## 13th of June

Did the entire pcb in one day.

Since this is technically a split board, I would normally have needed 2 micro controllers and ttrs. But I aint doing allat.

My design uses one microcontroller and uses 16 wires to connect the 2 halves and bring the right side matrix to the left.

The wires can also function as the way the 2 boards are held together(joke there will be more supports)

I still need to add silkscreen so its not technically done but functionality is done.

Anyways explaining the keyboard.

Its a normal keyboard thats about 75%ish idk it has 84 keys. 
it folds and has 16 wires to connect it together
