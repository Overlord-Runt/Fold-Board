# The Fold Board!

This is a super cool keyboard that I am making

It folds!

and fits nicely in a bag

## 13th of June

Did the entire pcb in one day.

Since this is technically a split board, I would normally have needed 2 micro controllers and ttrs. But I aint doing allat.

My design uses one microcontroller and uses 16 wires to connect the 2 halves and bring the right side matrix to the left.

The wires can also function as the way the 2 boards are held together(joke there will be more supports)

I still need to add silkscreen so its not technically done but functionality is done.

Anyways explaining the keyboard.

Its a normal keyboard thats about 75%ish idk it has 84 keys. 

it folds and has 16 wires to connect it together

Hours spent: 4

## 15th of June

Started work on the case and trying to guage out how I am going to figure out how to have the 2 halves connect and how I want it to look

Got this so far, spent a few hours on it and looks kinda nice. might do some more work onto it before moving to the fold

Hours spent: 2

## 17-20th June

Did little bits and bobs of work, not too much but small touches on the pcb, and cad whereever i got time.
total time across these days is like 2 hours max

## 21st of June

I am actually stupid.

can you spot the problem here?

thats right

i put 4 rows instead of 5

time to start from scratch again. YAAYAYAYAYA

anyways did lots of work today on my case, went through a few designs, got some of the nitty gritty down
